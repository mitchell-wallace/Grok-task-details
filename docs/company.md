Research recent AI-related product and capability updates from {{var}}. Focus on new or updated AI models and features (e.g., foundation models, multimodal, speech/TTS/STT, embeddings, agents, APIs, developer tools), including releases, previews, and notable technical improvements. Prioritize primary sources from {{var}} (official blog posts, docs, release notes, GitHub, press releases) and reputable reporting when primary sources aren’t available. Exclude purely business news unrelated to AI capabilities (funding rounds, general partnerships without product details, executive moves) unless it directly changes AI products or access. Summarize the key updates with enough detail that an engineer can understand what changed and why it matters.
